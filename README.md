##### What
A native iOS application enabling users to find, share, save, and contribute to disaster relief and other causes. Users can find causes they care about, and the Wildfire app provides a streamlined donation process, while facilitating sharing the cause or your contribution on Facebook.  
Written in Swift
Uses Cocoapods: FacebookSDK, SwiftyJSON, EZSwiftExtensions


##### Why
* Easier to locate, save, and contribute to causes
* Make it more fun and social
* Incentivization via social media
* Spread causes you care about

We hope Wildfire could make it easier for people to find and contribute to humanitarian causes.  The full app would aggregate causes and allow users to search by name, location, or categories. Wildfire makes philanthropy more social by providing Facebook login and tools to share causes and donation events. We hoped that these features could provide a way for social incentivization, where users' shared activity reminds or encourages others to contribute as well.  


## Installation
This app was built with Swift 2.2 and XCode v 7.3.  You can download the zip, open with Xcode, and build to the simulator and your device. Once Swift 3.0 comes, this app will need to be updated before it can be built with the latest Xcode and Swift 3.0.
